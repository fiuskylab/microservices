# microservices
A list of simple microservices to apply/improve your programming skills.

### Nice things to do:
- Choose a language that you feel confortable working with and/or wants to learn/apply.
- Deployment:
  - Locally (running it directly from the Terminal)
  - Docker Container
  - Docker Compose

### Microservice Ideas:
1. CRUD
  - A simple CRUD with in-memory DB
  - HTTP RESTful API
2. Auth
  - Handles requests to create, refresh and (in)validate Auth session
  - Choose at least one:
    - JWT
    - OAuth2
  - Will help you understand the difference between: OAuth2, JWT, Bearer Token, etc.
3. Message Sender:
  - RESTful API that receives a payload and sends it through a Messaging Service
  - Messaging Service, choose at least one:
    - Telegram
    - E-mail (Gmail, Microsoft Graph, etc.)
  - Support:
    - Text
    - Attachments (files)
